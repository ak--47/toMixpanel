# to Mixpanel

## update: 8/15/23

**tldr;** this package is **deprecated**. use **[the new stuff](#new)**.

originally the design of this module was an "all-in-one" ETL to bring data out of certain vendor tools into mixpanel to allow people to self-serve on data migrations and historical backfills.

but, product analytics data is BIG, and doing any kind of significant data volume on your personal computer (over a consumer grade internet connection), with no way to "resume" a job, is unreliable.

mixpanel has evolved dramatically over the last few years and with the release of [simple identity merge](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking/how-tos/identifying-users#simplified-vs-original-id-merge) and our [migration packages](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/other-bits/tutorials/migration-guides), much of the functionality in this this module is _no longer relevant_.

i have opted **not** to delete this repository, as the code works for certain cases (small data sets, mixpanel's [original identity merge](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking/how-tos/identifying-users#simplified-vs-original-id-merge) with `$merge` events, and incremental user props), however this module will receive no further updates. 

if you are looking to migrate your data from a vendor specific format to mixpanel, these are the packages you want:

## wat.

`toMixpanel` is an ETL script in Node.js that provides one-time data migrations from common product analytics tools... to mixpanel. 

It implements Mixpanel's [`/import` ](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/events#import-events), [`$merge`](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/identities#identity-merge) and [`/engage`](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/user-profiles) endpoints

It uses [service accounts](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/authentication#service-accounts) for authentication, and can batch import millions of events and user profiles quickly.

This script is meant to be run **locally** and requires a [JSON file for configuration](https://github.com/ak--47/toMixpanel/tree/main/examples). 




## tldr;
```
git clone https://github.com/ak--47/toMixpanel.git

cd toMixpanel/

npm install

node index.js ./path-To-JSON-config
```

alternatively:

```
npx to-mixpanel ./path-To-JSON-config
```

## Detailed Instructions

### Install Dependencies

This script uses `npm` to manage dependencies, similar to a web application. 

After cloning the repo, `cd` into the `/toMixpanel` and run:

```
npm install
```

this only needs to be done once.

### Config File

`toMixpanel` requires credentials for your `source` and your `destination`

Here's an example of a configuration file for `amplitude` => `mixpanel`:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "name": "amplitude",
    "params": {
      "api_key": "{{amplitude api key}}",
      "api_secret": "{{ amplitude api secret }}",
      "start_date": "2021-09-17",
      "end_date": "2021-09-17"
    },
    "options": {
      "save_local_copy": true,
      "is EU?": false
    }
  },
  "destination": {
    "name": "mixpanel",
    "project_id": "{{ project id }}",
    "token": "{{ project token }}",
    "service_account_user": "{{ mp service account }}",
    "service_account_pass": "{{ mp service secret }}",
    "options": {
      "is EU?": false,
	  "recordsPerBatch": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

you can find more configuration examples [in the repo](https://github.com/ak--47/toMixpanel/tree/main/examples).

## supported sources

options: `path_to_data` (for large datasets, does line-by-line iteration)


\*note: google analytics does not have public `/export` APIs, so you'll need to [export your data to bigQuery](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437618?hl=en) *first*, and then [export your bigQuery tables to google cloud storage](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3416092?hl=en#zippy=,in-this-article) **as JSON**. You can then [create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating) in google cloud storage which can access the bucket; the above-mentioned values are given to you when you create a service account
